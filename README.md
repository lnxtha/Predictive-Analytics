# Predictive-Analytics

## Introduction

As the legal environment evolves, cannabis stores encounter distinct challenges in selecting the most suitable locations for their businesses. Predictive analytics plays a crucial role in this process. By leveraging data analysis and data-driven decision-making, cannabis stores can enhance their operations and boost profitability.

In this presentation, we will delve into the concept of predictive analytics, its application in making data-driven decisions for cannabis stores, and the specific datasets and models utilized in our analysis. Additionally, we will share the outcomes of our geographical analysis and illustrate how the predictive model can guide informed decisions regarding cannabis store locations.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to maximize return on investment and leverage data-driven insights to determine the ideal site for a new cannabis store using predictive analytics. The investigation will concentrate on certain geographic regions and datasets pertaining to local laws, competition, and demography.

## Data Sources

- Data source includes Census data for targeted areas that include population data, density data, age, income and education level.
- Analysis of competitor that includes the number of existing cannabis stores, their locations, and their market share.
- Regulatory requirements and restrictions for cannabis stores in the targeted areas.

## Steps Taken:

- Basic statistics of object function/Target variable
- Random Sampling
- Correlation of all variables on all anlaytical file and determination of key model variables
- Exploarator data Analysis of all key variables
- Stepwise Regression

## Conclusion

- Key Findings:

- The decile analysis shows a clear trend where higher deciles (1-3) represent significantly higher consumption rates, indicating regions with potentially higher demand.
- The highest deciles have consumption rates that are substantially above the average, pointing to market segments with the most potential.

## Model Insights:

- The predictive model has identified specific variables (like HSRE011, HSRM014, etc.) that are most influential in predicting areas with high consumption rates.
- The use of a decision tree model (HPSPLIT) to segment the data effectively, which helps in pinpointing demographic and regional traits correlating with high consumption.
